(** Runtime events - ring buffer-based runtime tracing

    This module enables users to enable and subscribe to tracing events
    from the Garbage Collector and other parts of the OCaml runtime. This can
    be useful for diagnostic or performance monitoring purposes. This module
    can be used to subscribe to events for the current process or external
    processes asynchronously.

    When enabled (either via setting the OCAML_RUNTIME_EVENTS_START environment
    variable or calling Runtime_events.start) a file with the pid of the process
    and extension .events will be created. By default this is in the
    current directory but can be over-ridden by the OCAML_RUNTIME_EVENTS_DIR
    environment variable. Each domain maintains its own ring buffer in a section
    of the larger file into which it emits events.

    There is additionally a set of C APIs in runtime_events.h that can enable
    zero-impact monitoring of the current process or bindings for other
    languages.

    The runtime events system's behaviour can be controlled by the following
    environment variables:

    - OCAML_RUNTIME_EVENTS_START if set will cause the runtime events system
    to be started as part of the OCaml runtime initialization.

    - OCAML_RUNTIME_EVENTS_DIR sets the directory where the runtime events
    ring buffers will be located. If not present the program's working directory
    will be used.

  - OCAML_RUNTIME_EVENTS_PRESERVE if set will prevent the OCaml runtime from
    removing its ring buffers when it terminates. This can help if monitoring
    very short running programs.
